Font placement instructions

To render Arabic text correctly in PDFs, place an Arabic TTF/OTF file here.

Recommended fonts (open-source):

- Amiri: https://www.amirifont.org/
- Noto Naskh Arabic: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Naskh+Arabic
- Cairo: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cairo

Save the font file as `Amiri-Regular.ttf` (or update the path in the exporter code).
Example path used by exporter: `/fonts/Amiri-Regular.ttf`

After adding the font, refresh the app and export again.
